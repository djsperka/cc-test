# cc-test
This is the README for my cc-test project. 

## This is another header

That was another header type

### This is called "markdown"

Github uses a variant github-markdown. *italics* and **bold** and ***both*** are done like this.

Here is a bullet list
- first
- second
- third

And a numbered list
1. first
2. Second
3. Third
4. fourth

This is code: `git add myfile.txt`

And a code block
```
git init
git add newfile.txt
git commit -m "comment for commit"
```
